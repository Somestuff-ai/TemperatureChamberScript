# TemperatureChamberScript
 FCO560 Microcalibrator Temperature Logging Script: 
 The script works by communicating with a temperature control box to set the temperature in a temperature chamber.
 It then communicates with a FCO560 digital micromanometer to obtain readings for the temperature from the reference probe and check probe. 
 It also logs the EUT mA reading as well. Averages are calculated after a set of 20 readings are taken.
 The script also interacts with CS043 to automate the measurement process for company calibrations.
