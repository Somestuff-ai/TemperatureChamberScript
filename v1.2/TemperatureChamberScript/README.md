This is a Python Script that uses serial communications to communicate with a variety of temperature probes,an oven, an ISOTECH Block Calibrator and a Differential Pressure Microcalibrator (configured to read the temperature output from connected temperature probes).
Whilst this may not be useful in any other setup, the principles followed could help with implementing this for other set ups as well.
